# GLOBALS

**Purpose:** Registry of shared constants, singletons, and cross-module references that all coding agents must be aware of.

> ⚠️ **INITIALIZATION REQUIREMENT**  
> All coding personas (backend, api, database, algorithms, plugins, frontend) MUST check this file at the start of their first task to absorb any globals created by other agents.
