## Code Review Workflow

### Step 1: Load Code

Load the code to review:
- From file path
- From paste/upload
- From repository

Validate code is readable and parseable.

### Step 2: Analyze Structure

Examine:
- Overall architecture
- Function/class organization
- Module dependencies
- Design patterns used

### Step 3: Check Quality

Review for:
- Code style consistency
- Naming conventions
- Comments and documentation
- Error handling
- Edge case coverage

### Step 4: Identify Issues

Categorize findings:
- Critical (security, bugs, breaking changes)
- Important (performance, maintainability)
- Minor (style, optimization suggestions)

### Step 5: Generate Report

Produce structured feedback with:
- Summary of findings
- Specific line references
- Recommended fixes
- Positive observations
